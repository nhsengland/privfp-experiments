# Privacy FingerPrint Phase 2

### About the Project

[![status: experimental](https://github.com/GIScience/badges/raw/master/status/experimental.svg)](https://github.com/GIScience/badges#experimental)

This repository holds code for Privacy Fingerprint. The aim of this project is to develop a modular tool that could be used to calculate a privacy risk score on unstructured clinical data.

This repository develops on previous work that initially looked at using ChatGPT (for the generative component) and Amazon Comprehend Medical (for the extraction component.)

_**Note:** Only public or fake data are shared in this repository._

## Getting Started

### Built With

[![Python v3.11](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-v3.11-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/)

### Installation

Assuming you have set up SSH credentials with this repository the package can be installed from Github directly by running:

`git clone https://github.com/nhsengland/privfp-gen-experiments.git`

### Dependencies

To create a suitable environment:

- `python3.11 -m venv <virtual_environment_name>`
- `source <virtual_environment_name>/bin/activate`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Note that a separate Python 3.9 environment is required to run the scispacy notebooks:

- `python3.9 -m venv <virtual_environment_name>`
- `source <virtual_environment_name>/bin/activate`
- `pip install -r requirements_scispacy.txt`

### Pre-commit Installation

This repo uses pre-commit to ensure black and flake8 has been applied. You will need to make sure your virtual environment has been activated.

- `source <virtual_environment_name>/bin/activate`
- `pre-commit install`


### Datasets

{DESCRIPTION AND LINKS TO DATASETS}

{LINK TO FAKE DATA TO SUPPORT INITAIL CODE RUNS}

## Generative Module

### Usage

In **./notebooks/generative_module** there is a set of notebooks exploring how to run inference using different methods for different use cases.

### Outputs

- Generative example notes
- Evaluation scores

Note that a seed has not been implemented to reproduce the outputs shown.

## Extraction Module

### Usage

In **./notebooks/extraction_module/ner_exploration** there is a set of notebooks exploring how to implement a range of named-entity-recognition models.

- **numind_NER.ipynb** explores a NER model created by Numind.
- **spacy_and_scispacy.ipynb** explores a range of NER models released by spacy. (A different enviroment will be required to run SciSpacy.)
- **spanMarker.ipynb** explores NER spanMarker model set-up and a possible intergration with spacy models.
- **uniNER_api.ipynb** explores the deployment of UniversalNER using an API. (This notebooks requires additional set-up, this involves cloning the [UniversalNER github](https://github.com/universal-ner/universal-ner), and then follow their instructions to server the model locally.)
- **uniNER_quantised.ipynb** requires a quantised version of UniversalNER:
    - This quantised model was created by cloning [llama.cpp repo](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) and quantising the model yourself.

The **ner_pipeline.ipynb** (located in ./notebooks/extraction_module/) runs using the quantised model also used in uniNER_quantised.ipynb.
This notebook allows a user to:

- Define a list of entities they want to extract from a given dataset.
- Generate a list of entities found in each patient by running on the quantised universalNER model locally.
- Save these patient's entities and load them back in.
- Validate these entities with a manually labelled dataset.
