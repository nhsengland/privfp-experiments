# Open source LLM exploration

This section explores the use of open source LLMs for generating unstructured text from structured synthetic data as an extension to the [Privacy Fingerprint (PrivFp) Proof of Concept](https://github.com/nhsengland/privfp-poc) with a focus on running models locally.

Experiments and example notebooks for the generative component of PrivFp are available in the [privfp-experiments](https://github.com/nhsengland/privfp-experiments/tree/XZ-generative-component) repository.
