This folder has been created to showcase our work researching labelling and annotation tools.

We have researched these tools for the following reasons:
- Users may want to explore a new dataset.
- Users may want to see how effective the NER tool is with different entitiy names.

To use the streamlit tool, you will need to run the following command in your terminal:

`streamlit run streamlit_app.py -- --d "example_output/example_pipeline_14_05_24/llm.json"`

The string folling the --d argument should be the path to your data.
